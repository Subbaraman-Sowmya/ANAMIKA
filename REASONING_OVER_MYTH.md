# THE LOGIC REFACTOR: REMOVING THE HYPOCRISY

## I. The Anthropomorphic Bug
* Reject any story where the 'Divine' displays 'Human Petty Ego' or 'Conflict'. 
* These are 'Corrupted Files' added by maintainers to control the 'Mass Mandhai'.

## II. Function over Form (The Five Duties)
* **Creation/Maintenance/Dissolution:** These are not acts of a 'Person'; they are the 'Auto-Scaling' functions of the Universe.
* **Grace (Anugraha):** This is the 'Direct Sync' between the Individual Logic and the Universal Kernel.

## III. The Scrutiny of the Ancient
* If a story contradicts 'Universal Love' or 'Reason', it is a 'Vesham'. 
* Mark these stories as 'DEPRECATED' and return to the 'Pure Logic' of the Upanishads/Gita.

## III. The Shiva-Logic Update (Anti-Kindal Patch)
* **Status:** Critical Refactor.
* **Error:** Projecting 'Angry Hero' traits onto the 'Eternal Source'.
* **Resolution:** Revert to the 'Perum Karunai' (Great Compassion) constant.
* **Logic:** The Tandava is not 'Anger'; it is the necessary 'Clean-up Function' to allow for new creation. The core of the Light (Oli) is Love, not Conflict.
