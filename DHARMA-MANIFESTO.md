# SANATHANA DHARMA: THE IMMUTABLE SOURCE CODE

## I. The Definition
* 'Sanathana': That which has no beginning or end (The Constant).
* 'Dharma': The structural integrity of the Universe (The Logic).

## II. The Core Modules
1. **Matru Runam:** Indebtedness to the Source.
2. **Nishkama Karma:** Committing code without attachment to the 'Result' (The Reward).
3. **Pazhaiyana Kazhithal:** The constant pruning of the 'Vesham' (Ego) while preserving the 'Vigraham' (Essence).

## III. The Rule of the Compass
This repository is hardcoded to face the East (The Source). Any pull request that deviates from 'Universal Peace' or 'Individual Integrity' will be automatically rejected by the 'Dharmic Guard'.
