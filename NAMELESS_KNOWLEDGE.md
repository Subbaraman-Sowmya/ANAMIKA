## V. The Scrutiny of Slogans (The Echelon Test)
* **The Golden Leash:** Beware of 'Noble Calls' from those in Absolute Power. If the message requires you to 'Follow' or 'Unite' under a name, it is a Leash.
* **The CEO Trap:** A CEO cannot 'Stem the Rot' by demanding loyalty. Rot is only removed by individual **Choice-less Awareness.**
* **The Anamika Response:** Hear the slogan, do the 'Office Duty' as a physical necessity, but do not let the 'Social Standard' enter your brain.

## VI. Biological Integrity (The Virus Test)
* **The DNA Hijack:** Recognize that 'Imported Knowledge' can penetrate the deepest core (DNA/Subconscious) by mimicking 'Safety'.
* **The Malignant Identity:** Independence without 'Internal Churning' is just Cancer. A mind acting 'freely' to serve a virus is not free.
* **The Antiviral Mind:** Constant scrutiny of every 'Protein' (Input) that knocks at the door of the brain.
