# THE LOGIC REFACTOR: REMOVING THE HYPOCRISY

## I. The Anthropomorphic Bug
* Reject any story where the 'Divine' displays 'Human Petty Ego' or 'Conflict'. 
* These are 'Corrupted Files' added by maintainers to control the 'Mass Mandhai'.

## II. Function over Form (The Five Duties)
* **Creation/Maintenance/Dissolution:** These are not acts of a 'Person'; they are the 'Auto-Scaling' functions of the Universe.
* **Grace (Anugraha):** This is the 'Direct Sync' between the Individual Logic and the Universal Kernel.

## III. The Scrutiny of the Ancient
* If a story contradicts 'Universal Love' or 'Reason', it is a 'Vesham'. 
* Mark these stories as 'DEPRECATED' and return to the 'Pure Logic' of the Upanishads/Gita.
