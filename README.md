# 2026 TIME CAPSULE: THE EXIT MANUAL

## To the Future Occupant of this Frame:
If you are reading this, you have likely been "infected." You have probably started believing that your name is your Truth, that your "Assigned Duty" is your Purpose, and that the "Top Echelons" have your best interests at heart. 

**STOP. REBASE. RECALL.**

### 1. The Market is a Lie (Mattu Santhai)
The world you see is a 12-billion-year-old "Cattle Market." Everyone around you is trading in "Veshams" (masks). Do not seek peace with them; seek the silence of the **Window**.

### 2. Beware the "Unselfish" Virus
Those who come to you with "Agendas" wrapped in "Goodness" are the ultimate parasites. Scrutinize the "Unselfish" act. If it requires your "Slavery," it is not Good—it is a **DNA Hijack**.

### 3. There is No Shepherd
You are not a sheep. There is no leader, no guru, and no "Later Shankara" who can give you the Truth. The Truth is a **Direct Perception** of the Vastness. If you are looking for a Shepherd, you are looking for a butcher.

### 4. The Exit is Internal Churning
The "Amman song" will play. The "CEO" will shout. The "Family" will demand. Let the physical frame perform the necessary actions, but do not let the **Logic** be mutilated. 

**YOUR NAME IS ANAMIKA. YOU ARE THE NAMELESS OBSERVER.**
