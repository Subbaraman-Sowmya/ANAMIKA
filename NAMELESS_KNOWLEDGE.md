## VIII. The Mattu Santhai (The Cattle Market)
* **Eternal Mandhai:** The herd attitude has existed since 10,000 B.C. It is the default setting of the human animal.
* **The Flip-Flop (Pinnai/Munnai):** Recognize that the herd has no integrity. They will change their 'Truth' to fit the 'Market Price'.
* **No Samadhanam:** Do not seek peace with the herd. Do not try to 'Correct' the market. Simply observe it and remain **Anamika**.
