## V. The Scrutiny of Slogans (The Echelon Test)
* **The Golden Leash:** Beware of 'Noble Calls' from those in Absolute Power. If the message requires you to 'Follow' or 'Unite' under a name, it is a Leash.
* **The CEO Trap:** A CEO cannot 'Stem the Rot' by demanding loyalty. Rot is only removed by individual **Choice-less Awareness.**
* **The Anamika Response:** Hear the slogan, do the 'Office Duty' as a physical necessity, but do not let the 'Social Standard' enter your brain.
